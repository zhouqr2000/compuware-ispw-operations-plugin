# Compuware ISPW Operations Plugin

This plugin sends an ISPW rest API request to a CES rest endpoint.

## Features

The following features are available in both Pipeline and traditional
project types:

* ISPW Actions: CreateAssignment, GetAssignmentInfo, GetAssignmentTaskList, GenerateTasksInAssignment, PromoteAssignment, DeployAssignment,RegressAssignment, GetReleaseInfo, GetReleaseTaskList, CreateRelease, GenerateTasksInRelease, GetReleaseTaskGenerateListing, GetReleaseTaskInfo, PromoteRelease, DeployRelease, RegressRelease, GetSetInfoAction

### Basic plugin features

The following features are only present in the non-pipeline version of
the plugin. For the Pipeline version, these features are available
programmatically.

* You can send the build parameters as key-value property list
* You can configure CES URL in global configuration and CES token as secret text in Credentials
* You can chose to wait for end of action by polling style (freestyle and pipeline)
* You can chose to wait for end of action by webhook callback (pipeline only)

### Pipeline features

Suppose you want to generate all DEV2 tasks in assignment PLAY000313,
you can create the rest API request to CES server programmatically like so:

```groovy
ispwOperation connectionId: 'c56dcf99-f26c-4b4e-a826-1ae47cc4c9b4', consoleLogResponseBody: true, credentialsId: '733e1263-4334-4852-b4cc-27ebc4685b94', ispwAction: 'GenerateTasksInAssignment', ispwRequestBody: '''assignmentId=PLAY000313
level=DEV2
runtimeConfiguration=TPZP'''
```

Also in a Pipeline job, you can use webhook callback if you don't want polling for status:

```groovy
hook = ispwRegisterWebhook()
echo "...created ISPW webhook - ${hook.getURL()}"

ispwOperation connectionId: 'c56dcf99-f26c-4b4e-a826-1ae47cc4c9b4', consoleLogResponseBody: true, credentialsId: '733e1263-4334-4852-b4cc-27ebc4685b94', ispwAction: 'GenerateTasksInAssignment', ispwRequestBody: '''assignmentId=PLAY000313
level=DEV2
runtimeConfiguration=TPZP
events.name=Completed
events.body=Generated
events.httpHeaders=Jenkins-Crumb:no-crumb
events.credentials=admin:library'''

echo "...waiting ISPW webhook callback - ${hook.getURL()}"
data = ispwWaitForWebhook hook
echo "...ISPW Webhook called back with message - ${data}"
```
