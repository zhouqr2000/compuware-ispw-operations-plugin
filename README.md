# Overview

The Compuware ISPW Operations plugin allows Jenkins users to execute
ISPW operations, such as Generate, Promote, Deploy or Regress on the
mainframe. Users can seamlessly integrate ISPW build process with
Jenkins. 

### Prerequisites

The following are required to use this plugin:

-   Jenkins
-   Jenkins Credentials plugin
-   Jenkins Plain Credentials plugin
-   Compuware Common Configuration plugin - latest
-   Compuware mainframe ISPW
-   Compuware CES

### Additional Information for the Git to ISPW Sync Functionality
-   Refer to the following [guide](https://devops.api.compuware.com/guidelines/ispw/GIT_to_ISPW_Integration_Tutorial.html) for more information
-   Required: minimum version of Topaz Workbench CLI version 20.01.01 [installed](https://devops.api.compuware.com/tool_configuration/plugins.html#installing-the-topaz-workbench-cli)

### Installing in a Jenkins Instance

-   Install the Compuware ISPW Operations plugin according to the
    Jenkins instructions for installing plugins. Dependent plugins will
    automatically be installed.

  

### Configuring Host Connections and CES Tokens

-   If no host connection appears in the **Host Connections** section,
    click **Add Host Connection **and add a host connection by entering
    the following information:

    -   In the **Description **field, enter a description of the
        connection.

    -   In the **Host:port **field, enter the z/OS host to connect to.

    -   From the **Code page** list, select the desired code page to be
        used for this connection. The code page is used to translate
        data sent to and from the host. The default is 1047.

    -   In the **Read/write timeout (minutes)** field, enter the number
        of minutes for the plugin to wait for a response from the host
        before timing out.

    -   In the **CES URL** field, enter the CES server URL. The default
        is empty. It is not required for other Compuware plugins but is
        required to use this plugin. Please do NOT attach any context
        path, it should be in the format:
        [http://host:port](http://hostport/).

    **Note:** Click **Delete Host Connection** to delete an existing
    connection.

-   If you intend to use webhook callback
    -   Jenkins URL in section Jenkins Location must be defined with the
        Jenkins server IP address (not localhost or 127.0.0.1)
    -   If you do NOT want the CES callback to provide Jenkins crumb,
        you need to go to Manage Jenkins \| Configure Global Security
        page, then turn off 'Prevent Cross Request Forgery exploits' in
        CSRF Protection section. Otherwise, you have to acquire the
        Jenkins crumb from CES server host and provide the Jenkins crumb
        as property **events.httpHeaders=Jenkins-Crumb:{Jenkins
        crumb}** in the **Request** body in the job. To acquire a
        Jenkins crumb, please reference
        - <https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Remote+access+API>
-   If no CES token appears in the CES secret token section, 
    -   Click Credentials \| System \| Global credentials \| Add
        Credentials, select Kind to 'Secret text'
    -   Provide the CES token as Secret
    -   Leave ID as blank (it will generated by Jenkins)
    -   Give a a meaningful description, then Add

  

### Executing ISPW Operations

-   On the **Configuration** page of the job or project,
    select **Execute a Compuware ISPW Operation** from
    the **Build** section.

-   From the **Host connection** list, select the host connection to be
    used to connect to CES host. Alternatively, to add a connection,
    click **Manage connections**. The **Host connections** section of
    the Jenkins configuration page appears so a connection can be added.

-   In the **CES secret token** list, select the CES token configured in
    the CES host for the ISPW. Alternatively, click **Add** to add
    secret text as token using the Plain Credentials plugin. Refer to
    the Jenkins documentation for the Plain Credentials plugin.
-   In the **Action** section to define what ISPW operation to perform
    -   AddTask
    -   BuildAssignment
    -   BuildRelease
    -   BuildTask
    -   CancelAssignment
    -   CancelDeployment
    -   CancelRelease
    -   CloseAssignment
    -   CloseRelease
    -   CreateAssignment
    -   CreateRelease
    -   DeployAssignment
    -   DeployRelease
    -   FallbackAssignment
    -   FallbackRelease
    -   GenerateTasksInAssignment
    -   GenerateTasksInRelease
    -   GetAssignmentInfo
    -   GetAssignmentTaskList
    -   GetContainerList
    -   GetReleaseInfo
    -   GetReleaseTaskGenerateListing
    -   GetReleaseTaskInfo
    -   GetReleaseTaskList
    -   GetSetInfo
    -   GetSetTaskList
    -   GetWorkList
    -   PromoteAssignment
    -   PromoteRelease
    -   RegressAssignment
    -   RegressRelease
    -   RemoveFromRelease
    -   SetOperation
    -   TaskLoad
    -   TransferTask
-   In the **Request** section, please specify additional request
    parameters, click the question mark for more details. Each of the
    action may have different set of properties, if the job support web
    hook callback, additional event related properties must be provided.
    The webhook callback only works for pipeline build.

### Using Pipeline Syntax to Generate Pipeline Script

1.  Do one of the following:

    -   When working with an existing Pipeline job, click the **Pipeline
        Syntax** link in the left panel. The **Snippet
        Generator** appears.

    -   When configuring a Pipeline job, click the **Pipeline
        Syntax** link at the bottom of the **Pipeline** configuration
        section. The **Snippet Generator** appears.

2.  From the **Sample Step** list, select **ispwOperation: Perform a
    Compuware ISPW Rest API request and return a JSON object**.

3.  From the **Host connection** list, select the host connection that
    contains a valid CES URL.

4.  From the **CES secret token**, select the corresponding CES token
    for the CES server.

5.  From the **Action**, select the ISPW operation to be performed.
6.  From the **Request** body, enter the corresponding properties for
    the specific action, click question mark help for more detail for
    each action
7.  Click **Generate Pipeline Script**. The Groovy script to invoke the
    Compuware ISPW Operations plugin appears. The script can be added to
    the Pipeline section when configuring a Pipeline job. A sample
    script is shown below:

```
ispwOperation connectionId: 'e0fbb6eb-b01d-4d55-b18b-2f321c174474', credentialsId: 'f1d2762b-9a40-46ad-a9df-b982147acc85', ispwAction: 'GenerateTasksInAssignment', ispwRequestBody: '''assignmentId=PLAY000313
level=DEV2
runtimeConfiguration=TPZP'''
```

For webhook callback, a sample script is shown below

```
hook = ispwRegisterWebhook()
echo "...creating ISPW Jenkins webhook - ${hook.getURL()}"

ispwOperation connectionId: 'e0fbb6eb-b01d-4d55-b18b-2f321c174474', credentialsId: 'f1d2762b-9a40-46ad-a9df-b982147acc85', ispwAction: 'GenerateTasksInAssignment', ispwRequestBody: '''assignmentId=PLAY000313
level=DEV2
runtimeConfiguration=TPZP
events.name=Completed
events.body=Generated
events.httpHeaders=Jenkins-Crumb:no-crumb
events.credentials=admin:library'''

echo "...waiting ISPW Jenkins webhook callback - ${hook.getURL()}"

data = ispwWaitForWebhook hook
echo "...CES called back with message: ${data}"
```

**Note:** If the **Response body in** **console **option is checked, then debug
message will be printed within the Jenkins log. 

&nbsp;

The following is another example, that after generate and a webhook callback, an intelligent test case change set for total test is also created. Please note that event body is set to $$setid$$, so, it will be replaced with CES callback, the real set id is going to be used as next query for a set info status. If the level is specified as a none empty string, it will produce a TTT change set. 

```
node {
    stage('generate and webhook demo') {
    	
    	/* create callback endpoint in jenkins */
    	
		hook = ispwRegisterWebhook()
		echo "...creating ISPW Jenkins web hook - ${hook.getURL()}"

		/* generate on assignment with notification callback. when the generate is complete, the webhook callback should has a setid payload */
		
		ispwOperation connectionId: 'e35ab9c9-cf4e-4748-95bc-390312ebcc7e', consoleLogResponseBody: true, credentialsId: 'ces-token-xdevreg', ispwAction: 'GenerateTasksInAssignment', ispwRequestBody: '''assignmentId=PLAY003149
		level=DEV2
		runtimeConfiguration=TPZP
		events.name=Completed
		events.body=$$setid$$
		events.httpHeaders=Jenkins-Crumb:no-crumb
		events.credentials=admin:library
		'''

		echo "...waiting ISPW Jenkins web hook callback - ${hook.getURL()}"

		/* waiting for webhook callback from ces, if triggered, the data contains setid */
		
		data = ispwWaitForWebhook hook
		echo "...CES called back with message: ${data}"

		/* construct a request body with a setid and a none empty level. The value of the level is not important. The get set action will return the load libraries and the product TTT change set */

		def reqbody = "setId=${data}\nlevel=tttchangeset\n"
		ispwOperation connectionId: 'e35ab9c9-cf4e-4748-95bc-390312ebcc7e', consoleLogResponseBody: true, credentialsId: 'ces-token-xdevreg', ispwAction: 'GetSetInfo', ispwRequestBody: "${reqbody}"
    }
}

```

### Pipeline Build Requirement

In order to use pipeline build, your ISPW, CMSC and CES have to be
configured properly in order to receive webhook notification. See
explanation in the following figure.
